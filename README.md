# Evo-Lexis
Emergence and Evolution of Hierarchical Structure in Complex Systems

This is the implementation of the Evo-Lexis framework presented in the paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.04924.

## Requirements
* The code uses a slightly modified (in terms of I/O) version of the suffix library, proposed in [2].
* The code uses NetworkX package [3] for graph algorithms.

## Installation
* Make sure to compile the code in repeats1 directory by simply running ```make```.
* Make sure to install NetworkX by running ```pip install networkx```.
* Make sure to install NumPy by running ```pip install numpy```.
* Make sure to install SciPy by running ```pip install scipy```.
* Make sure to install editdistance by running ```pip install editdistance```.
